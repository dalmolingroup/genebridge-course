# OrthoGuide: Pre-computed Gene Rooting Data

OrthoGuide is available at <https://dalmolingroup.imd.ufrn.br/orthoguide/> and provides immediate access to high-quality, pre-computed rooting data for 8 species. Instead of running complex analyses, users can query this database and get the information they need in seconds, along with a few exploratory plots.

## How OrthoGuide Works

All data in the database is generated using the [GeneBridge R package (v0.99.2)](https://github.com/dalmolingroup/genebridge).
The gene-to-COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) information was obtained from STRING-db version 11.0.
