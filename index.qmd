👥 **Target Audience:** Researchers, graduate students, and biologists interested in evolutionary analysis.

📶 **Level:** Intermediate

⬅️ **Prerequisites**
To be able to follow this course, learners should have knowledge in:

1.  Basic knowledge of the R programming language (loading libraries, handling data frames).
2.  Familiarity with fundamental concepts in evolutionary biology (e.g., genes, orthologs, phylogenetic trees).
3.  Being comfortable working with RStudio or a similar R environment.

📖 **Description**
This repository contains the materials for the course "GeneBridge: Inferring the Evolutionary Rooting of Orthologous Genes," organized by from Dalmolin's Systems Biology Group, based at the Bioinformatics Multidisciplinary Environment (BioME) at UFRN. This workshop is divided into three parts: (1) Performing the Rooting Analysis, (2) Plotting Rooted Genes, and (3) Plotting Abundances.

➡️ **Learning Outcomes:**
By the end of the course, learners will be able to:

1.  **Understand** the theoretical basis of evolutionary rooting and the Bridge algorithm. [Understanding]
2.  **Apply** the GeneBridge package to infer the evolutionary root for a set of orthologous genes. [Applying]
3.  **Analyze** and **interpret** the output tables and rooting results. [Analysing]
4.  **Create** and **customize** plots to visualize rooted genes on a phylogenetic tree. [Creating]
5.  **Generate** and **evaluate** plots of gene abundances across different clades. [Evaluating]

⌛ **Time estimation**: 180 minutes

⚙️ **Requirements:** Participants must have a laptop with a recent version of R and RStudio installed. Specific R package dependencies (e.g., GeneBridge) are detailed in the repository's setup instructions.
